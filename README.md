🧠 Problem Statement

Modern financial markets are highly influenced by multiple factors—economic data, global events, and social sentiment.
However, this information is scattered across sources and difficult to interpret quickly.
This project aims to integrate and analyze these diverse data streams in one place to predict short-term market movements and visualize trends effectively.

🎯 Objectives

Integrate financial, social, and market data sources.

Use sentiment analysis and machine learning for accurate forecasting.

Present real-time visual insights through an interactive dashboard.

Assist users in making informed trading or investment decisions.
