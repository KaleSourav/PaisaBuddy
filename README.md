💬 Social Sentiment Analysis:
Uses NLP to analyze public mood from platforms like Twitter or Reddit.

🤖 Machine Learning Predictions:
Applies ML models to forecast short-term market trends (e.g., bullish, bearish, or neutral).

📊 Interactive Dashboard:
Displays market data, sentiment trends, and prediction outputs in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

🔔 Alerts & Insights:
Sends trend alerts and highlights emerging market opportunities.

🧠 Problem Statement

Modern financial markets are highly influenced by multiple factors—economic data, global events, and social sentiment.
However, this information is scattered across sources and difficult to interpret quickly.
This project aims to integrate and analyze these diverse data streams in one place to predict short-term market movements and visualize trends effectively.

🎯 Objectives

Integrate financial, social, and market data sources.

Use sentiment analysis and machine learning for accurate forecasting.

Present real-time visual insights through an interactive dashboard.

Assist users in making informed trading or investment decisions.
